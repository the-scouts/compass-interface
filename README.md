# Compass Interface â€” The unofficial Compass API

The ***Compass Interface*** project aims to provide a unified and well-documented API to 
the Scouts' national membership system, *[Compass](https://compass.scouts.org.uk)*. 

The project aims to: 
 - increase flexibility and simplicity when developing applications that interface with *Compass* data, 
 - provide  stability and abstract complexities of *Compass*, and 
 - enable greater support to our adult  volunteers and members. 

***Compass Interface*** is naturally [open source](https://github.com/the-scouts/compass-interface) 
and is licensed under the **[MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)**.
